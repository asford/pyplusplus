Help needed!

`pyplusplus`_ documentation is always under active development. It is not an easy
task to create and maintain it. I will appriciate any help! 

How can you help?

* Lets face it: today it is not possible to use `pyplusplus`_ without looking
  into source code sometimes. `pyplusplus`_ uses `Epydoc`_ to generate 
  documentation from source files. So, if you found some undocumented piece of 
  code and you understand what it does, please write documentation string.
  
* You are reading documentation and my English cause you to scream? Please, fix
  those errors and send me new version of the document. I will integrate the 
  changes.

* Do you think, that the documentation is not clear, I will be glad to improve it,
  just point me to the place.
