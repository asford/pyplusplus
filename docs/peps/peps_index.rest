Description
-----------

This page is an official `Py++`_ "TODO" page.

For small features, the description of the feature and it's implementation will
be written here. Big features will get their own page.

---------------
Unnamed classes
---------------

There is no technical reason why unnamed classes/structs/unions are not exported

by `Py++`_:

.. code-block:: C++

  class Foo{
      union {
          struct {
              float r,g,b,a;
          };
          float val[4];
      };
  };


Implementation details
----------------------

As it seems to me, the only code that should be changed is
"pyplusplus/module_creator/creator.py" file. To be more specific: all code creators,
for declarations in unnamed classes, should be created under named class.

The coding itself should take something like 4 - 5 hours, including unit test.

---------------------
Call wrapper policies
---------------------

Not all functions could be exposed to Python as is. This `document`__ will
explain how `Py++`_ will help users to create wrappers around those functions.

Please read `DSL challenge`_ document and contribute your ideas, thoughts or just
comments.

Unicode support
---------------

In version 0.8.1 `Py++`_ introduced nice feature: automatic extraction and
integration of documentation strings. I estimated wrong the influence of the
feature on the project. First user, who actually tried it, was Gottfried Ganssauge.
He asked me to add support for documentation string that contains unicode characters.
These days I understand the influence. I should convert all strings in the whole 
project to be unicode strings, with encoding specified by the user. This is a 
lot of work, but I think this is really important. So this is high priority "TODO".

http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html - a nice article, which
explains what is unicode, encoding and character sets.
