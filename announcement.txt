Hello!

I'm pleased to announce the 0.8.5 release of Py++. 

What is Py++?
=============

Py++ is an object-oriented framework for creating a code generator for 
Boost.Python library.

What's new?
===========

Features

* Added "Function Transformation" feature:
  http://language-binding.net/pyplusplus/documentation/functions/transformation/transformation.html

* Added new functionality, which allows you to control messages and warnings: 
  http://language-binding.net/pyplusplus/documentation/feedback.html#how-to-disable-warning-s

* Adding new algorithm, which controls the registration order of the functions.
  http://language-binding.net/pyplusplus/documentation/functions/registration_order.html
  
* Added new "Py++" defined "return_pointee_value" call policy:
  http://language-binding.net/pyplusplus/documentation/functions/call_policies.html#py-defined-call-policies
  
* Opaque types are fully supported:
  http://language-binding.net/pyplusplus/documentation/functions/call_policies.html#special-case


Small features
--------------

* It is possible to configure "Py++" to generate faster ( compilation time )
  code for indexing suite version 2. See API documentation.

* The algorithm, which finds all class properties was improved. Now it provides 
  a better way to control properties creation. A property that would hide another 
  exposed declaration will not be registered\\created.

* Work around for "custom smart pointer as member variable" Boost.Python bug
  was introduced.
